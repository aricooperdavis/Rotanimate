# Rotanimate
A Python library that saves frames from a rotating 3D matplotlib plot so that you can sow them together using [ImageMagick](https://www.imagemagick.org/script/command-line-processing.php)/[Gifsicle](https://www.lcdf.org/gifsicle/)/[ImageJ](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/docs/guide/146-8.html) or your tool of choice.

*Initial code and design shamelessly stolen from [Zulko's "The Sugar High" blog](https://zulko.wordpress.com/2012/09/29/animate-your-3d-plots-with-pythons-matplotlib/)*
